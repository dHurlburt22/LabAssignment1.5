    <h1>Earth</h1>

    <p>This is our home, our place of existence, the big ball of dirt we call the Earth. Earth is the third planet away from the sun,
        allowing us to be toasty many times of the year, but keeping us from being a little bit more than sunburnt. From historical records,
        the Earth is calculated to be around 4.5 billion years old, that's even older than my grandpa! And finally, we have day
        and night cycles as a result of the Earth being on an axis, so as time goes on through the year it spins on that axis 
        changing the suns ray patterns on various parts of our big beautiful world.
