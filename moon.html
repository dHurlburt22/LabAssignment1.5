    <h1>Moon</h1>

    <p>This is the big ball of rock, that is definetely not made from cheese that is the moon. The moon is said
        to have been created when from a piece of the Earth that was blown off from a collision, long, long, long ago. The moon also 
        has a big part to play on the tides of the Earth, the gravitational pull it has causes bulges to form in the ocean, creating what
        we know as tides. The moon also is said to have dust that astronauts have noted it smells of gunpowder, how's that for a rooting, 
        tooting, super smokey surprise.
